# PythonBeginnerProgramming2021
Welcome to this repository of mine! I've been working on this since December 2020 to showcase my progress in learning Python. My plan is to finish up this repository soon.
Once I'm finished, I will be creating a Pygame repository in which I'll start using Al Sweigart's "Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python, 4th Edition" to create my own projects with Pygame and then after that, I'll start working on an intermediate repository to dive deeper into Python topics.
