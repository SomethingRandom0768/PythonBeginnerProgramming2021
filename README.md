# PythonBeginnerProgramming2021
Welcome to this repository of mine! I've been working on this since December 2020 to showcase my progress in learning Python and I'm planning to finish this repository soon.
Once I'm finished, I will be creating up a intermediate repository which will dive into deeper topics ( Data Structures, Dictionaries and Sets, Function Decorators, Object References, Mutability, and Recycling, etc. )
