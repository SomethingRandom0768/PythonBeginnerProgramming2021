# PythonBeginnerProgramming2021
Welcome to this repository of mine! I've been working on this since December 2020 to showcase my progress in learning Python. My plan is to finish up this repository soon.
Once I'm finished, I will be creating a Pygame repository in which I'll start making small projects for fun. The exercises for this repository comes from the book Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes, I recommend you get it! It's awesome!
