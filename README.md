# PythonBeginnerProgramming2021
Welcome to this repository of mine! I've been working on this since December 2020 to showcase my progress in learning Python. This repository is now finished. The remaining projects in the books that I have worked on in private repositories, so I won't be releasing those ones, unfortunately. However, I have been working with Panda3D recently and I am currently working on a Toontown minigame (using the Toontown School House codebase) on my own! I hope to release a video of it soon once I can finish.
