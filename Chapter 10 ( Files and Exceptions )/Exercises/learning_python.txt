So far I've learned about:
In Python you use : instead of ; like in Java
In Python there are lists and dictionaries as well as tuples and sets
In Python you can also sort, reverse, and even temporarily sort lists
In Python you can also create for and while loops
In Python you can get user input using input() which is a lot easier than getting java.util.scanner in Java
